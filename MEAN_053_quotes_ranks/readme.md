Objectives:
Create a full CRUD app with Angular, Express, Node, and MongoDB

Continue building off the Authors assignment. Create an application where users view authors and their famous quotes. List all the authors on the first page. From there, the user may click on a button to see each author's famous quotes. The user may then vote up, vote down, and delete the different quotes.  

Also add forms so the user may contribute new authors and new quotes.

Include the ability to edit an author's name.

Use backend validations to ensure that all author names and quotes are at least three characters long. If the user does not pass validations, display an error message.
